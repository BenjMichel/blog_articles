# Did you miss Best of Web 2015 ? Read my summary !

In a nutshell, Best of Web 2015 was an amazing conf related to front-end
technos. It took place in Paris on June 5th and gathered 8 groups of meetups :
* [AngularJS](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Paris/)
* [Backbone.js](http://www.meetup.com/backbone-paris/)
* [Web Components](http://www.meetup.com/paris-webComponents/)
* [EmberJs](http://www.meetup.com/EmberJS-Paris/)
* [Node.js](http://www.meetup.com/Nodejs-Paris/)
* [PhoneGap/Cordova](http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-Paris/)
* [D3.js](http://www.meetup.com/D3-js-Paris/)
* [Paris.js](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-js/)

The aim was to select the best talk of each meetup and to replay them during
this conf. Indeed, with a the growing number of meetups related to Web, we can't
attend all, so this was this occasion to heard the best ones.

## The best talk

The best talk of the day was the **opening keynote** (*Christophe Porteneuve*).
His narration of the history of the Web from the dark ages to today
enables us to understand how it evolved and how awesome the current ecosystem is :
preprocessor, frameworks, transpilers, SPA, the emergence of Node.js, etc.
He pointed out the problem with the current educational system regarding the
formation of web developers, which isn't to me a real problem, since you can
easily train yourself on the Internet. He raised the issue of privacy on the
Internet shared his idealistic position about the role of a developer : to help
people, not to make money. He started the heated debate of the day : AngularJS
vs the other JS frameworks.
At BAM, we are fans of Angular and use it for most of our projects and will
continue to use it when the 2.0 version will be released.

## The most spectacular talks

These three presentations had really cool demonstrations:

* *Norbert Schnell* and *Samuel Goldszmidt* in **Web Audio now !** showed us how
to manipulate sound with a Web API and to broadcast a music in all the conference
room thanks to the smartphones connected to a server.

* *Mickael Dumand* spoke about **Kinect** and demonstrate how to use it to
manipulate a web page with motion. He couldn't show the original project he
worked for : a lingerie brand (what a shame !). It's a pity that Microsoft
didn't open its Kinect API  for the js, thus building web application for Kinect
doesn't seem easy, even if his demonstration was cool.

* *RaphaÃ«l Luta* presents **real-time vizualisations with D3.js**. This library
can display dashboard with all kinds of indicators. During his presentation, he
asks us to vote on Tweeter for the best superhero and a webpage displayed the
result in real-time (this poll was a bit useless, everyone knows it is Batman...).
To my mind, it is a really powerful library but not easy to take control of
(in comparison with js charts libraries like Highcharts).

## The coolest talk

*Martin Gorner* (**Material Design with Polymer**) explains us what the Material
Design is and its philosophy : based on a paper we can cut or move, its aim is
to be very informative. This part was quite refreshing, a talk on design in
contrast with all the talks on code. The second part was about Polymer, an
implementation of Web Components. Now that the version 1.0 is released, Polymer
is the new trendy techno to use to make reusable Web Components.

## The talks: "I will think about it the next time I need it"

*Virginie Bardales* talked about **REST Api** and especially on the conventions
related to the different levels of REST. This presentation was very helpful to
improve the relation between front-end and back-end through API. It also showed
that we can't always comply with the REST specification and we have to take some
freedom from it, for instance: a RESTful API implies there is only one URL to
get a resource (e.g. "/users"), which prevents us from versioning the API (e.g.
"/1.1/users" and "/1.2/users").

**Tarifa CLI**(*Paul Panserrieu*) is a command-line that can build Cordova
projects with more options. But let see if it is really customizable.

*Florent Duveau* defended his framework (**Why choosing Backbone in 2015 ?**).
He stated that Backbone is not comparable with Angular and Ember, as its aims
is binding the data and not views. It seems mature and light.


## The talk: "Oh, I'm a bit lost here!"

*Douglas Duteil* told us about his winning **ES2015 ready Angular web stack**.
Dealing with a very interesting subject for all the JS developers : Ecmascript
2015, the speaker lost me because I didn't know several of libraries he
mentioned and what was their role or what was the link between them.

## The talk: "I will keep an eye on"

**CSS grid** (presented by *Mathieu Parisot*) seems a efficient way to arrange
your HTML element on a grid. Unfortunately, it is not currently implemented on
browsers, so I am waiting for it (keep an eye on http://caniuse.com/ to know
whether you can use an HTML/CSS feature).

## The others talks:

I'm sorry for the 2 last talks of the day (**Reactive Programming with RxJS** by
*Hugo Cordier* and **Building an application with Ember.js in 2015** by *Tom
Coquereau*), I wasn't receptive since my brain was completely burnt by the dense
and hot day. I also missed the presentation of **NodeWebkit** by *Jacopo Daeli*
(I will not admit I was playing at the Viseo quizz game at that moment or
watching the tennis game...).

In addition to these talks, there were some stands like Mozilla who promoted its
mobile operating system Firefox OS and its developer edition for Firefox.


## My top 3 of stands:

* **Eleven Labs** for their TV so we could watch the game between Tsonga and Wawrinka
* **Sfeir** for their cookies. They also had beers but I'm more a cookie person ;)
* **Viseo** for their fun quizz game

**Thanks to all the speakers, organisers and sponsors for this great conf !**
